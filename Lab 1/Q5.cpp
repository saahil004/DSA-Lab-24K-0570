/*
Q5. Create a database with Teacher class to store the teacherâ€™s name, the subject they teach,
and their years of experience, with the name and subject stored as dynamic strings. First, write
the class without a copy constructor or assignment operator and observe what happens when
you copy one teacher object into another (shallow copy problem). Then implement the Rule of
Three to fix the issue. Display both teacher objects before and after the fix to demonstrate the
difference.
